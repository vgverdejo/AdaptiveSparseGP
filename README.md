# Adaptive Sparse Gaussian Processes

This repository includes the implemention of the Adaptive Sparse Gaussian Process proposed in the paper:

Vanessa Gómez-Verdejo and Manel Martínez-Ramón, "Adaptive Sparse Gaussian Process Regression". Submitted to Pattern Recognition, 2022.

In the directory lib/ you can find the library files and in the directory notebooks/ there are two notebooks which replicates the paper experiemnts and an additional notebook ('Demo_ToyProblem') that you can use to get familiar with the different models and functions.
